        <p>My name is Dan Tambo, but that's making it too easy for you: my middle name is Ochieng'. It is kind of
            tricky
            for a non-African to pronounce so I'll give you a trick to master it: split it into three syllables
            O-chi-eng'
            and make sure you pronounce all vowels in the phonic way (i.e as short vowels). The accent above the 'g'
            is
            to indicate that it ends in a soft 'ng' as in 'sing' and not hard as in 'hunger'. Incidentally, the word
            Asante (in yellow in the image above) is the Kiswahili word for Thank You.</p>

        <p>I come from Kenya originally, but have been living in the UK for the past 32 years. During that time I've
            had several jobs including Betting Shop Cashier, Betting Shop Manager, Community Organiser, Project
            Officer
            for a small charity, free-lance Home Tutor and others. I've even had a three-month stint on a
            supermarket
            check-out counter!</p>


        <p>I chose to enrol on this coding course run by CodeNation because I wanted to learn the basics of coding in
            order
            to
            keep in touch
            with technology as it evolves. It also gives me a better chance of getting a job working remotely from
            home
            as
            opposed to a 9 to 5 office job - which doesn't interest me anymore at this stage in my life.</p>
