        <p>The day 30th March, 2020 was a sad day for most music lovers when it was announced that Bill Withers, the
            renowned singer/songwriter, had died in a Los Angeles hospital at the age of 81 due to heart complications.
        </p>

        <p>His death came at a time when the general public worldwide had drawn inspiration from his music while in
            lockdown
            during
            the coronavirus pandemic. His song 'Lean on me', which is a paean to friendship, became the most popular
            song
            from
            which many people drew inspiration and solace during the devastating early weeks and months of the pandemic.
            Many
            healthcare workers, choirs, artists and private individuals from all around the world posted their
            renditions of the song on social media
            and the internet.</p>

        <p class=blue_moon><em><b>"I'm not a virtuoso," he is quoted by Rolling Stone magazine as having said, "but I
                    was able to
                    write songs that
                    many
                    people could identify with. I don't think I've done bad for a guy from Slab Fork, West
                    Virginia."</em></b>

        <p>Bill Withers decided to retire from recording after the end of his contract with Columbia Records in 1985
            because of his disillusionment with the record industry. Having found success in music later in life than
            most (at 32), he said that he had been socialised as a regular guy so he didn't feel an inherent need to
            keep on
            recording once he fell out of love with the industry.</p>
